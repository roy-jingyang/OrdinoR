This module contains methods for associating discovered organizational groups
with execution modes.

    '''Assign an execution mode to a group, as long as there exists a member
    resource of this group that have executed this mode, i.e. everything done
    by each member matters.

    Note: this is the method proposed by Song & van der Aalst, DSS 2008,
    namely "entity_assignment".

    Params:
        group: iterator
            The ids of resources as a resource group.
        rl: DataFrame
            The resource log.

            The execution modes corresponding to the resources.
