This module contains methods for importing event log data. Currently supporting
    [âˆš] Disco-exported CSV format (https://fluxicon.com/disco/)

'''
Data exchange format for an event log - all methods in this module MUST return
the successfully imported event log as a pandas DataFrames:
    'case_id', 'activity', 'resource', 'timestamp',
 0
 1
 .
 .
 .
 n                                           }

Note: 
    The indices are created using integers increasing from 0, each of which
corresponds to one event.
    The original event log data should at least provide the information of the
activity ids. It is expected that the resource ids and timestamps are presented
as well (not mandotory though).
    Other extensible data attributes can be appended according to different 
purposes of working projects and the event log(s) acquired.
