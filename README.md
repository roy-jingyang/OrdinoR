## Organizational Mining: Process Mining on organizational perspective

Whereas lion's share of research in process mining has been devoted to the control-flow perspective of business processes, event log data may also contain a wealth of information related to other pespectives, e.g. organizational perspective, time perspective \[1\]. 

*Organizational mining* focuses on discovering organizational knowledge such as organizational structures and social networks \[2\]. For example, *organizational model mining* can help extract the structural patterns of employees, and may support decision-makers in better understanding *de facto* grouping of human resources related to a business process in an organization \[3\].

The research topic of organizational mining was first proposed by Song and van der Aalst \[2\]. Three types of mining are discussed:
* *Discovery*: deriving models to describe the reality as reflected by event logs, e.g. organizational models, social networks, assignment rules, resource behavior.
* *Conformance*: investigating the (mis-)alignment between modeled behavior and those observed in event logs.
* *Extension*: enriching or improving existing models using information extracted from event logs.

My current research aims at gaining a more comprehensive understanding of organizational mining, with a specific focus on the topic of organizational model mining for which the object of study is the grouping of resources. Project *OrgMiner* is a prototype implementing the tools and techniques related to this research.
