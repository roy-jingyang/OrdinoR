## Organizational Mining: Process Mining on the organizational perspective

Whereas lion's share of research in process mining has been devoted to the control-flow perspective of business processes, event log data may also contain a wealth of information related to other pespectives, e.g. organizational perspective, time perspective \[1\]. 

*Organizational mining* focuses on discovering organizational knowledge such as organizational structures and social networks \[2\], which enables decision-makers and managers to gain a better understanding of the *de facto* grouping of human resources and their interaction patterns \[3\].

The organizational mining research spectrum was first proposed by Song and van der Aalst \[2\], in which three dimensions are defined:
* *Discovery*: construct models that reflect the reality. Topics of interest include:
    * organizational model mining: find the grouping of resources along with the relationships between resource groups and tasks.
    * social networks: use Social Network Analysis \(SNA\) techniques to help understand the structure of communication between resources and groups.
    * rules: discover rules related to staff assignment and \(runtime\) activity distribution.
* *Conformance checking*: examine whether the modeled behaviour matches the observed one.
* *Extension*: enrich an existing model by extending it through the projection of information extracted from the logs onto the initial model.

My current research interest lies in developing techniques to support a more comprehensive understanding of organizational mining.
